# Virus.prank-database
Legacy Script Pranks: Digital Archive (.bat &amp; .vbs) Welcome to Legacy Script Pranks, a centralized archive of classic scripts and harmless "viruses" that defined the era of digital pranks in IT labs and early Windows environments. This project is a digital time capsule focused on preserving vintage Batch and VBScript-based recreational coding.
