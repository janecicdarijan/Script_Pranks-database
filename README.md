# Legacy Script Pranks: Digital Archive (.bat & .vbs)

Welcome to **Legacy Script Pranks**, a centralized archive of classic scripts and harmless "viruses" that defined the era of digital pranks in IT labs and early Windows environments. This project is a digital time capsule focused on preserving vintage Batch and VBScript-based recreational coding.

## 📌 About the Project
This repository contains a collection of educational and entertaining scripts designed to simulate system errors, unusual computer behavior, or retro text interfaces. All scripts are open-source, easy to analyze, and serve as excellent examples for understanding basic Windows automation and scripting.

### Archive Contents:
* **Batch (.bat) Scripts:** Command-line manipulations, loop messages, and simulated system shutdowns.
* **VBScript (.vbs) Pranks:** Infinite pop-up windows, simulated typing effects, CD-ROM tray manipulation, and text-to-speech messages.
* **Ready-to-use Packages:** Pre-structured bundles for testing in safe, isolated environments.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Usage Guidelines

> **Important:** The content of this repository is intended strictly for **educational and entertainment purposes**.

By using the scripts provided in this repository, you agree to the following:

* **Ethics & Consent:** Use these scripts **only** with the prior, explicit consent of the person you are pranking. Unauthorized use on systems you do not own or have permission to use is strictly discouraged.
* **Responsibility:** The author of this project assumes **no responsibility** for any misuse, unintended data loss, or misunderstandings caused by the execution of these files. You use these files at your own risk.
* **Safety First:** While these scripts are designed to be "harmless" (meaning they do not cause permanent damage to hardware or core system files), it is highly recommended to run them within a **Virtual Machine (VM)** or a sandbox environment to understand their behavior before sharing.
* **Legal Compliance:** Ensure that your use of these scripts complies with your local laws and the platform's Terms of Service.

## 🚀 How to Use
All scripts are available in raw format or as part of a **.zip** package in the [Releases] section.

1.  **Explore the directories:** Browse folders categorized by script type.
2.  **Inspect before running:** Right-click any file and select "Edit" to inspect the source code.

## 🛡️ Safe Testing Environment

To ensure a safe experience while exploring these scripts, we recommend using one of the following methods:

### 1. Windows Sandbox (Recommended)
If you are on Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise:
* Enable **Windows Sandbox** in "Turn Windows features on or off".
* Run the sandbox, copy the code into a Notepad file, and save it as `.bat` or `.vbs`.
* Everything you do inside the Sandbox is deleted once you close it.

### 2. Virtual Machines (VM)
Use software like **VirtualBox** or **VMware** to create an isolated Windows environment. This is the gold standard for testing scripts without any risk to your host operating system.

### 3. Review the Code
Always right-click a script and select **Edit** to view the source code. Our scripts are transparent and commented so you can learn exactly how they work before execution.
