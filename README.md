Legacy Script Pranks: Digital Archive (.bat & .vbs)
Welcome to Legacy Script Pranks, a centralized archive of classic scripts and harmless "viruses" that defined the era of digital pranks in IT labs and early Windows environments. This project is a digital time capsule focused on preserving vintage Batch and VBScript-based recreational coding.

📌 About the Project
This repository contains a collection of educational and entertaining scripts designed to simulate system errors, unusual computer behavior, or retro text interfaces. All scripts are open-source, easy to analyze, and serve as excellent examples for understanding basic Windows automation and scripting.

Archive Contents:
Batch (.bat) Scripts: Command-line manipulations, loop messages, and simulated system shutdowns.

VBScript (.vbs) Pranks: Infinite pop-up windows, simulated typing effects, CD-ROM tray manipulation, and text-to-speech messages.

Ready-to-use Packages: Pre-structured bundles for testing in safe, isolated environments (Virtual Machines).

⚠️ Disclaimer
Important: The content of this repository is intended strictly for educational and entertainment purposes.

Ethics: Use these scripts only with the prior consent of the person you are pranking.

Responsibility: The author of this project assumes no responsibility for any misuse, data loss, or misunderstandings caused by the execution of these files.

Safety: While these scripts are "harmless" (they do not cause permanent damage to hardware or system files), it is highly recommended to run them within a Virtual Machine (VM) or a sandbox environment to understand their behavior before sharing.

🚀 How to Use
All scripts are available in raw format or as part of a .zip package in the [Releases] section.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/legacy-script-pranks.git

Explore the directories by script type.

Right-click and select "Edit" to inspect the source code before running.
