# Legacy Script Pranks: Digital Archive (.bat & .vbs)

Welcome to **Legacy Script Pranks**, a centralized archive of classic scripts and harmless "viruses" that defined the era of digital pranks in IT labs and early Windows environments. This project is a digital time capsule focused on preserving vintage Batch and VBScript-based recreational coding.

## 📌 About the Project
This repository contains a collection of educational and entertaining scripts designed to simulate system errors, unusual computer behavior, or retro text interfaces. All scripts are open-source, easy to analyze, and serve as excellent examples for understanding basic Windows automation and scripting.

### Archive Contents:
* **Batch (.bat) Scripts:** Command-line manipulations, loop messages, and simulated system shutdowns.
* **VBScript (.vbs) Pranks:** Infinite pop-up windows, simulated typing effects, CD-ROM tray manipulation, and text-to-speech messages.
* **Ready-to-use Packages:** Pre-structured bundles for testing in safe, isolated environments.
